# Project Proposal

## Project Title
PetPal

## **What and Why?**

* PetPal is a mobile web application designed to connect pet owners with trusted pet sitters and walkers in their local area. Many pet owners struggle to find reliable care for their pets when they are busy or traveling. This app will provide a convenient platform where pet owners can book services from verified pet sitters and walkers, ensuring their pets are cared for by experienced individuals.

* The problem this system solves is the difficulty and uncertainty that many pet owners face when trying to find trustworthy pet care. Existing options like asking friends or using generic classifieds don’t guarantee the level of trust or professionalism needed. PetPal offers a solution by vetting sitters and walkers, allowing owners to feel confident in the safety and well-being of their pets.

* This problem is important because pets are like family members, and their care is a top priority for pet owners. By offering a reliable, verified network of sitters and walkers, PetPal gives pet owners peace of mind while away from their pets.

### **For Whom?**

* PetPal is designed for pet owners who need occasional or regular care for their pets, such as dog walking, pet sitting, or overnight stays. This app caters to busy professionals, frequent travelers, and anyone who wants to ensure their pets receive proper care in their absence. The initial target users are pet owners in urban and suburban areas where there’s a high demand for these services.

### **How?**

* Users can search for pet sitters or walkers in their area, filter results based on availability, services offered, and ratings.

* The app allows users to book services directly and securely pay through the platform.

* All pet sitters and walkers are required to create detailed profiles with information about their experience, reviews from previous clients, and certifications, if any.

* Pet sitters and walkers can send updates, including photos and messages, to owners during their service, ensuring transparency.

* After services are completed, pet owners can rate their sitters or walkers and leave reviews to help future users make informed decisions.

* Owners can leave emergency contacts, vet information, and specific care instructions for their pets.

### **Scope**

The project is scoped for a team of 4-5 programmers to complete within one semester. The main focus will be on building the sitter/walker search system, the booking and payment features, and real-time updates. The rating and review system adds complexity without being too difficult to implement. The overall project is achievable within the given time frame, and the combination of features makes it a practical, engaging challenge for the team.
